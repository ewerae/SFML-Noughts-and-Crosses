# Noughts-and-Crosses
Wanted an introduction to the SFML library so I made this simple 2 player tictactoe game.


Just has the main logic core, but you can drag and drop symbols.

Eventually wanting to create a vs AI with this, maybe using the mixmac algorithm, but I'm using this as a placeholder so I can improve upon it.
There's something else I want to create currently.
