# Noughts-and-Crosses

Wanted an introduction to the SFML library so I made this simple 2 player tictactoe game in Linux.

Just has the main core logic behind the game and in addition you can drag and drop symbols.

Eventually wanting to create a vs AI with this, maybe using the mixmax algorithm, but I'm using this as a placeholder so I have to improve upon it.
There's something else I want to create currently.
