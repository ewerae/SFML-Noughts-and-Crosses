# Noughts-and-Crosses


![](https://github.com/ewerae/Noughts-and-Crosses/blob/main/tictactoe.gif)


Wanted an introduction to the SFML library so I made this simple 2 player tictactoe game in Linux.

Has the main core logic, and in addition you can drag and drop. For now, the winner is displayed on the left hand side. 

I want to incorporate some game theory in crafting the AI for this, but currently I want to create something else so.

Also want to expand onto adding a whole plethora of easy base games. With a UI to go between all. Could be fun.
